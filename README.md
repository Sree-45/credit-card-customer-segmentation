Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
==============================================

Overview
--------

This project uses a credit card dataset to perform customer segmentation. The goal is to group customers based on their spending behavior and financial profiles, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.

Project Objectives
------------------

-   **Identify distinct customer segments:** Use unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to uncover patterns in credit card usage and financial behavior.

-   **Provide actionable insights:** Enable data-driven decision-making for targeted marketing strategies.

Data Files
----------

-   **credit_card_dataset.csv:**\
    Raw dataset containing credit card data.

-   **Clustered_Customer_Data.csv:**\
    Processed dataset with assigned cluster labels.

Analysis and Modeling
---------------------

-   **Customer_Segmentation-final.ipynb:**\
    Jupyter Notebook that documents the complete workflow, including:

    -   Data preprocessing

    -   Exploratory data analysis

    -   Feature engineering

    -   K-Means model training

    -   Cluster visualization

-   **kmeans_model.pkl:**\
    Serialized (pickled) version of the trained K-Means clustering model used for predicting customer segments on new data.

Project Structure
-----------------

-   `credit_card_dataset.csv` -- Raw credit card data

-   `Clustered_Customer_Data.csv` -- Data with cluster labels

-   `Customer_Segmentation-final.ipynb` -- Notebook with analysis and model training

-   `kmeans_model.pkl` -- Saved K-Means model

Requirements
------------

-   **Python 3.x**

-   **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**

-   **Python Libraries:**

    -   pandas

    -   numpy

    -   matplotlib

    -   seaborn

    -   scikit-learn

Installation
------------

Install the necessary packages using pip:

bash

Copy code

`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

How to Run the Project
----------------------

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name`

### 2\. Launch the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook by running:

bash

Copy code

`jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation-final.ipynb`

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to process the data, train the model, and analyze clusters.

### 3\. Using the Trained Model

To predict clusters for new data, load the pre-trained model with the following code:

python

Copy code

`import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load the pre-trained model
with open('kmeans_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    kmeans_model = pickle.load(file)

# Prepare new data (ensure the format matches the training data)
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    # 'feature1': [value1],
    # 'feature2': [value2],
    # Add additional features as needed
})

# Predict the cluster
predicted_cluster = kmeans_model.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted cluster:", predicted_cluster)`

Results and Insights
--------------------

-   **Insights into Customer Behavior:**\
    The analysis reveals distinct customer segments based on financial behavior.

-   **Targeted Marketing Strategies:**\
    Identified segments can be used to tailor marketing approaches for each customer group.

-   **Data-Driven Decision Making:**\
    The clustering model supports informed decisions in customer relationship management.
